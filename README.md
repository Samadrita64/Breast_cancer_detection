# Breast_cancer_detection
Breast cancer detection refers to the methods and procedures used to identify breast cancer, either before or after symptoms appear. It involves various screening and diagnostic tests, including mammograms, ultrasounds, MRIs, and biopsies, with the goal of finding cancer early, when it is most treatable. 
Here's a breakdown of common breast cancer detection methods:
Mammography:
A type of X-ray used to screen for and diagnose breast cancer by detecting abnormal breast tissue, even before symptoms develop. 
Breast Ultrasound:
Uses sound waves to create images of the breast tissue, especially helpful for distinguishing between solid masses and fluid-filled cysts. 
Breast MRI:
Uses magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed images of the breast, particularly useful for women with dense breast tissue or those at high risk. 
Biopsy:
The only way to definitively diagnose breast cancer. It involves taking a tissue sample from the breast for examination under a microscope.
